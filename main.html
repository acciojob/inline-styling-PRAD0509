        <p>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants
            (plants of the division Angiospermae). Flowers produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants consist of a
            few haploid cells which produce gametes. The "male" gametophyte, which produces non-motile sperm, is
            enclosed within pollen grains; the "female" gametophyte is contained within the ovule. When pollen from the
            anther of a flower is deposited on the stigma, this is called pollination. Some flowers may self-pollinate,
            producing seed using pollen from the same flower or a different flower of the same plant, but others have
            mechanisms to prevent self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, when pollen is transferred from the
            anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species.</p>

        <p>Roses are multi-petal flowers available in an array of colours. Some varieties are known for their prickles
            along the stems of the plant, which are used to deter predators. Many species are now cultivated although
            there are still varieties that grow in the wild.</p>
